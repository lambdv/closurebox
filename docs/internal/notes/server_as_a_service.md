üß© Essential Features to Wrap for Good DX
1. üñ•Ô∏è Compute Metadata & Tagging
Instance name / alias (user-friendly, not AWS ID)

Public DNS/IP

Region + AZ

Instance type (t3.micro, etc.)

State (running/stopped)

Custom tags (for grouping or team/org info)

System uptime

2. üîê Access & Credentials
Web-based terminal (Wetty, Guacamole) or secure ssh command generator

Key pair management:

Upload custom SSH key (public)

Auto-generate ephemeral key for web-based SSH

Optional: GPG or YubiKey support

Optional: "sudo user" scaffolding per machine

3. üß∞ Provisioning Controls
Let the user:

Select OS image (Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, etc.)

Choose region, instance type

Supply custom user data / cloud-init

Snapshot + clone instance

Optional:

Volume size and auto backup settings

Firewall rules (wrapped around security groups)

4. üì° Networking Abstractions
Show public/private IPs

Internal DNS / routing name (e.g., dev-app123.platform.io)

Port management UI (firewall + security group abstraction)

Static IP (Elastic IP) attachment

5. üì¶ Dev-Focused Features
üü¢ For DX, expose:
One-click SSH command

Web terminal

Git deploy hook (to the VM) (like a bare-bones PaaS)

Upload/download files from browser

Service health checks (HTTP probe / ping)

Basic logging console (e.g., tail logs via journald or PM2)

6. üîÑ Lifecycle Controls
Start / Stop / Reboot / Terminate instance buttons

Auto shutdown timer (e.g., shut down after N hours)

Scheduled restart for cron-style workflows

7. üõ°Ô∏è Access Control / Team Features
Invite users to instance/project

Role-based access: viewer, dev, admin

Audit logs: who accessed/changed what

Per-instance SSH key provisioning (bind a user to a VM)

8. üí¨ Observability & Diagnostics (DX Enhancer)
CPU, RAM, Disk, and Network charts (CloudWatch)

Logs: EC2 system logs + /var/log/...

Error events: failed boots, provisioning errors

9. ‚öôÔ∏è Extras for Great DX
Auto DNS mapping (subdomain per VM: app123.dev.myplatform.io)

Startup script editor (to tweak init boot behavior)

One-click SSH from VS Code Remote (via .ssh/config generator)

Webhook for deploy / post-provision automation

Snapshots/backup UI

Docker integration if possible (e.g., "start this Docker image")

üõ†Ô∏è Backend Stack You'll Need
EC2 API access: DescribeInstances, CreateTags, StartInstances, etc.

Key Management System (e.g., AWS KMS or Vault)

Session-based SSH key/agent forwarding (if you do web-based SSH)

DB to track users, instance metadata, permissions

Possibly: a bastion or gateway proxy if you don‚Äôt want direct IP exposure

üß™ Sample Use Case (What the Dev Would See)
You log into your dashboard ‚Üí see all your dev VMs ‚Üí click one:

Renamed as ‚Äústaging-app‚Äù

SSH into it instantly from browser

Deploy code via git push (custom hook)

Setup health check on port 3000

Invite a teammate to access it

See logs + restart the VM if needed

After a week of no use, it auto-shuts down (configurable)
